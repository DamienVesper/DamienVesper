# Hi, I'm Damien!

I am a fullstack Javascript developer and accessibility specialist that tinkers with Node.js projects as well as websites in my spare time.
I originally started as a web developer focusing on responsive web design late 2015, and then later journeyed to serverside content and Node.js late 2019.
Additionally, I am an enthusiastic [typist](https://nitrotype.com/racer/DamienVesper), tech nerd, and [chess geek](https://lichess.org/@/DamienVesper).

I have been a backend developer for [Krew.io](https://krew.io) and the sole maintainer of [Krewclassic.io](https://krewclassic.io) since September 2020.
Additionally, I worked as an open-source developer for [TheTypingMatch](https://github.com/TheTypingMatch) accessories, namely Discord bots, while developing [The Walls Project](https://thewallsproject.org), a community project, on the side.

I am a system administrator of [Alliance Reunited](https://alru.ga), a gaming community, since early 2018.
I also developed [LeCashBot](https://lecashbot.cf), which allows users to gain [Nitro Type](https://nitrotype.com) cash from chatting in Discord servers, starting December 2019.
